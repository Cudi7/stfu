## üöÄ Getting Started (For Developers & Curious Minds)

Want to peek under the hood or even get this bad boy running locally? Here's how to get started. Fair warning: setting up a full social app always has a few "fun" steps! üòâ

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (LTS recommended)
* npm or Yarn
* Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
2.  **Install dependencies:**
3.  **Environment Variables:** Check them in the .env.local
4.  **Database Schema & Functions:** For security and brevity in this public README, the full database schema (tables, RLS policies, functions, triggers) is not directly included here. However, I can provide it upon request or during a deeper discussion about the project architecture. It includes tables for users, posts, reactions, replies, categories, and more, along with necessary row-level security (RLS) and custom functions for optimized operations.

1.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    This will open a new browser window with the Expo Dev Tools. You can then run the app on an iOS simulator, Android emulator, or on your physical device using the Expo Go app.
